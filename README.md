<h1> What you won't see </h1>
<ol>
  <li>5 images in the very top. It shows maximum of page capability.</li>
  <li>Full-size image if it has no information. Requirments look ambiguously in this place. They say that image should be full-size when there is no data and show message 'image does not have any data' at the same time.</li>
  <li>Google map or any other map.</li>
  <li>Razor. As I started with knonkoutJS, with one I ended.</li>
</ol>
